# PEDSO_MDPI
Model and scenarios used for the publication in MDPI energies journal for reusult credibility, accesability and suggestions

This repository contains the data and Python code supporting the "ZZZ" MDPI energies publication.
PEDSO (Positive Energy District System Optimiser) is a custom-made mixed integer linear programming approach for evaluation of Positive Energy Districts. It is based on Pyomo.
While PEDSO is developed towards a Open Source model, it still is missing some feature according to the FAIR criteria, most importantly a correct documentation. All data used in the Excel input files are based on open and public data that are cited in the article.
